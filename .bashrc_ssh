# some ssh(es) I regularly use
# Obviously, they keep changing with changing projects
# Remove -y flag if you want to disable X11 forwarding

# To provide passwords directly in the ssh command
# A feature to use if you are very regularly logging in and logging out of a machine
# It could be annoyiong to enter your passwords regularly
# Just hope non-authorized users are not snooping around for "things" on your machine,
# since here you will literally spoon-feed them with vital piece of information
# The passowrds are stored in a file called .ssh_credentials. Please run chmod a-rwx ~/.ssh_credentials
# commnad on the file once you write your password on this and hope nobody knows your root password.
